This project is set up to show the differences among methods to show HTML in a NativeScript Angular app. Not webview specific. I'm trying to find a reliable way to show HTML content so the content renders similarly on iOS and Android.Below are the plugins that I am using. Here is a [screenshot](screenshot.png) of the current app.

@nativescript/core

- WebView
- HtmlView

@nativescript-community

- AWebView
- HtmlLabel

###How to run:

iOS:
$ns run ios

Android:
$ns run android
